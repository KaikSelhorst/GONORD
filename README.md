### What is ImageGoNord

Gonord is an CLI (Command Line Interface) designed to make the already existing ImageGoNord CLI much more user friendly. It functions by allowing users to quickly and easily replace colors of images with colors of themes they have selected.

### What is CLI

A `command line interface`, or CLI, is a means of interacting with a computer program through text-based commands. Instead of using a `graphical user interface` (GUI), which visualizes interactions with the program, a CLI requires users to type commands to achieve the desired outcome.

There are many advantages to using a CLI. Firstly, it allows for more precise control over the program and its functions. Secondly, it is often faster to use a CLI, as it requires fewer steps to execute commands than a GUI. Additionally, CLI commands can be automated and batched, which can save time and increase efficiency.

### What is my CLI

My CLI is easier to use and more intuitive, since the user won't need to type the CLI directory like it's done in the original and it also comes with some new features like transformation by folder.

### Minimum requirements

- Node: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- Python: A high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language
- Pip: A package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python


### Install
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/KaikSelhorst/GONORD.git

# Install dependencies
cd GONORD
# Nord Dependencies
npm install
# Python Dependencies
pip install -r ./ImageGoNord/requirements.txt

# Global Command
npm install -g

# Run terminal CLI
GONORD
```

### Features

- Folder Transform
- Automatic Output
- Custom Output


### Performance

This CLI doesn't have the best performance on 4k images, so you need a better computer to make the transformations faster, even if you don't have the transformations they still happen but slower
